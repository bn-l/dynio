## Installation

Run installer for your OS in releases

## Setup

1. Start dynio then check `~/.dynio` or `C:\Users\INSERT_YOUR_USERNAME\.dynio`. 
2. Example general settings
command config files will have been created along with their schemas.

If your editor supports 
intellisense or similar for editing yaml files with schema (like vscode does) then it's 
easy to edit both files as the descriptions for all options are in the schema.

The app watches its config dir and will relaunch after any changes.
